Welcome good sers and m'lady. This is our GitHub repository, where we will store all our documentation and code.
First things first, what is Git?

Git is a version control system. It takes snapshots of the repository (i.e. directory) and keeps track of the changes in each
snapshot. Using git we will each have a local copy of the filesystem stored at GitHub.com, our shared 'repository'.
We can 'pull' the latest version of the repo, 'branch' off so we dont screw up the 'master' branch (stuff that works), modify files, 'commit' the changes to a snapshot, and 'push' the changes back upstream to the online repo. This README file is created in any new repository and acts as the front page with changelogs, major contributors etc but for us we will leave it as instructions on Git, and the changelog goes in the Code/Code.md file.

##Common usage:
We first need to create the repo locally. Download the github for windows/linux/mac first, then run the GUI or shell, whichever you prefer.
Click the plus sign on the top left, and add the repository using the [url for our repo](https://github.com/House-of-Faintree/jousting-tournament).
