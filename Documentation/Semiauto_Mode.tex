A fully automatic system could be implemented using a convex optimisation and control algorithm. The following method steps through the design and implementation of model predictive control (MPC). MPC uses the dynamic model of the system and predicts the outcome for a set of control inputs over a finite horizon. As a differential drive robot has dynamics that are coupled and non-linear, the gradient method was used to optimise the set of control inputs over the horizon. The least squares method from a set of reference states was used to quantify the cost associated with a particular set of controls, in which the optimisation algorithm found the minimum cost. Once the optimised set of controls was calculated, only the first timestep of controls is applied to the system. At the next timestep, the actual state of the system is measured, however not all of the modeled states are required for feedback. Using the known state, the algorithm is run again to find the next set of optimised control inputs. By only applying one timestep of controls at a time, any external disturbances, measurement noise and dynamic model uncertainty is accounted for. A 'timestep' refers to the length of time a control input is constant. The dynamic model uses fourth order runge-kutta to integrate over each of these timesteps for an accurate representation of the states.




\paragraph{Kinematics of a Differential Drive Robot}
There are two frames of reference used, the inertial frame $x_I,y_I$ (or global frame) and the robot frame $x_R,y_R$ in a right-hand sense, see Figure \ref{fig:robotdiagram}. A rotational matrix is used to rotate about the concurrent z axis by an angle $\theta$, see Eq \eqref{rotation}.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[clip,trim=0 11cm 21.5cm 0  ,width=0.5\linewidth]{./robotdiagram.pdf}
\caption{Inertial and robot frames of reference}
\label{fig:robotdiagram}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
X_I = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\
	\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix} X_R \label{rotation}
\end{equation}

The state vector of the system is $X = \left[x_I,y_I,\theta,\phi_R,\phi_L,\xd_I,\yd_I,\thetad,\dot{\phi}_R,\dot{\phi}_L\right]^T$ where $\phi_x,\dot{\phi}_x$ are the angle and angular velocity of the left and right wheel. The subscript 'I' is dropped for the inertial frame position and linear velocity. The control vector of the system is $U = [\tau_R,\tau_L]^T$ where $\tau_x$ is the torque applied to the left and right wheel. The coordinates are also represented as $q = [x_I,y_I,\theta,\phi_R,\phi_L]$ for ease.

The dynamic constraints on the system are determined by using the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The centre of mass is at the centre of symmetry ($y_R$ axis) and along the axis of applied torque at the wheels ($y_R$ axis)
\item No skidding of the wheels: $yd_R = 0 $
\item No slipping of the wheels
\end{enumerate}
The angular velocity of the robot $\thetad$ is related to the angular velocity of the wheels by Figure \ref{fig:robotschematic}.  
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[clip,trim=0 15cm 27cm 0, width=0.5\linewidth]{./robotschematic}
\caption{Diagram of the differential drive of the robot. Where R is the radius of the wheels.}
\label{fig:robotschematic}
\end{figure}

\begin{eqnarray}
s_L &=& c\theta \nonumber\\
\frac{ds_L}{dt} &=& c\frac{d\theta}{dt} \nonumber\\ 
R\dot{\phi}_L &=& c\thetad \label{langles}\\
s_R &=& (c+L)\theta \nonumber\\
\frac{ds_R}{dt} &=& (c+L)\frac{d\theta}{dt} \nonumber\\ 
R\dot{\phi}_L &=& (c+L)\thetad \label{rangles}
\end{eqnarray}
As $\thetad$ must be equal for both Eq. \eqref{langles} \eqref{rangles}, the radius of curvature c is Eq. \eqref{radc}. This results in Eq.\eqref{eqthetad} for the no skid constraint.
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{R\dot{\phi}_R}{R\dot{\phi}_R} &=& \frac{c+L}{c}\nonumber\\
c &=& \frac{L\dot{\phi}_L}{\dot{\phi}_R - \dot{\phi}_L} \label{radc}\\
\thetad &=& \frac{R}{L}\left( \dot{\phi}_R - \dot{\phi}_L \right) \label{eqthetad}
\end{eqnarray}
The inertial velocity of the robot is the average linear velocity of each wheel. This results in the relationship between the inertial states and the wheel states:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\xd \\ \yd \\ \thetad
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{R}{2}\left( \dot{\phi}_R + \dot{\phi}_L \right)\cos\theta \\
\frac{R}{2}\left( \dot{\phi}_R + \dot{\phi}_L \right)\sin\theta \\
\frac{R}{L}\left( \dot{\phi}_R - \dot{\phi}_L \right) 
\end{bmatrix} \label{cons}
\end{equation}
The constraint matrix C(q) is defined as $C(q)^T\dot{q} = 0$. Rearranging Eq.\eqref{cons} into this form is:
\begin{equation}
C(q) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0 & -R/2 & -R/2 \\
-\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 &  & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -R/2 & R/2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


\paragraph{Dynamics of a Differential Drive Robot}
Lagrangian dynamics of the system are governed by the euler-lagrange equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{\partial \Lagr}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right)+\frac{\partial \Lagr}{\partial q_i} = F + C(q)^T\lam
\end{eqnarray}
Where $\lam = [\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3]^T$ are the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. $\Lagr$ is the Lagrangian Eq.\ref{lag}, which is defined by the difference between the kinetic and potential energy of the system.
\begin{eqnarray}
\Lagr = \mathcal{T}-\mathcal{V} \label{lag}
\end{eqnarray}
The kinetic energy $\mathcal{T}$ of the robot is the sum of the translational and rotational kinetic energy of the body and rotational kinetic energy of each wheel. There is no potential energy as the robot is only used in the x-y plane.
\begin{eqnarray}
\Lagr = \frac{1}{2}m_t\left( \xd^2+\yd^2 \right) + \frac{1}{2}I_t\thetad^2+\frac{1}{2}I_w\left( \dot{\phi}_R^2 + \dot{\phi}_L^2\right)
\end{eqnarray}



 
\begin{eqnarray}
\ddot{x} = -\thetad \left( \xd \cost\sint + \yd\sin^2(\theta)  \right) - 2I_w\thetad\left( -\xd \sint\cost + \yd \cos^2(\theta) \right) +   \label{xdd}
\end{eqnarray}
