%\section{Software Design}  dont include at the end but you can for seperate builds
The software requirements and overview have been dealt with elsewhere in this document. The present section addresses the design and implementation of the software that forms the X system.
\subsection{Software Design Process}
How you went about designing the software – top down, bottom up, OOD, functional view, etc.
\subsubsection{Software Development Environment}
The tools that were used, both software (compilers, assemblers, etc) and hardware (development boards, etc.).
\subsubsection{Software Implementation Stages and Test Plans}
Describe the way you went about implementing the software - staged implementation, pseudocode (PDL), unit testing procedures, integration testing, etc. Identify dependencies – e.g this had to be done before that, etc.
\subsection{Software Quality Assurance}
Describe any measures that were taken to control (improve) the software quality – code or documentation standards, code walkthroughs, testing and validation, etc.

\subsection{Software Design Description}
\subsubsection{Architecture}
Describe the high-level architecture of the software – that is, the top-level flow of control, and how the various functional modules communicate.\\
In this section, you can put state transition diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.
\subsubsection{Software Interface}
Describe the public interface of each software module.
\subsubsection{Software Components}
This is a detailed view of the internal workings of each of the software modules.

\subsection{Preconditions for Software}
\subsubsection{Preconditions for System Startup}
Describe any preconditions that must be satisfied before the system can be started.
\subsubsection{Preconditions for System Shutdown}
Describe any preconditions that must be satisfied before the system can be stopped.
