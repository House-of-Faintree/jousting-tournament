%\section{System Description}
This section is intended to give a general overview of the basis for the something system design, of its division into hardware and software modules, and of its development and implementation.  
\subsection{Introduction}
Give a technical description of the function of the whole system, in terms of its constituent parts, here termed modules. Generally, a module will have hardware and software parts.
\subsection{Operational Scenarios}
Describe how the system is to be used. There may be several different ways that it can be used, perhaps involving different users, or classes of user. Present use case diagrams here if you are using them. Each operational scenario is a part through a use case diagram â€“ a way of using the system, with different outcomes or methods of use. \\
You should also consider the various failures that may occur, and the consequences of these failures.

\subsection{System Requirements}
The operational scenarios considered place certain requirements on the whole something system, and on the modules that comprise it.\\
Statement of requirements that affect the system as a whole, and are not restricted to only a subset of its modules.

\subsection{Module Design}
Describe the breakdown of the design into functional modules. Each module probably contains both software and hardware.\\
Then include a section like the following (2.5) for each module. Not all of the sub-headings may be relevant for each module.
