Created October 25th and correct as of 14PM 26/10/2015.
Update this as things get finished


Currently finished:
- Menu_navigation skeleton; ready to be further manipulated to suit final operation
- Able to change variables (such as max speed) across radio link through menu-nav
- Motor control is finished (for manual) but not integrated


To be tested:
- Handshaking sequence is written but needs to be tested with other components, timer 0 has some issues. -LEO+ZIJI	
	-TMR0 and TMR1 still not working properly as the overflow interrupt does not clear, put it at the end of a while loop.
- Remote control of manual mode from joysticks using the menu_nav loop - To be done today ZIJI
	-done, type conversion need to be careful
- IR tracking; independent of integration

- IR integration with feedback loop of control system
	
- Move menu-nav and LCD to MNML     - To be done today LEO 
	-already done


To be written:
- Further menu_nav behaviour based on other modes; things like more user date while operating and also IR stats

Others:
- Commander needs to be soldered and built
