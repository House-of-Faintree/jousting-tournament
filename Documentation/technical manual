1.    Introduction
1.1.    Document Identification
This document describes the design of Robotic System for Jousting. This document is prepared by Group Leo Lou for assessment in MTRX3700 in 2015.
1.2.    System Overview
The Robotic System is a system that can be controlled by the user or it can run in a fully automatic mode. Through the Xbee, the motor driver board (Pololu 707), the PWM motor, encoder and joysticks that controlled by the user. The robotic system (which is a mobile robot) can be operated in manual mode, auto assist mode and automatic mode. In addition, the status of the robotic can be displayed on a LCD screen.

2.    System Description
This section is intended to give a general overview of the robotic system and the controller module, of its division into hardware and software modules, and of its development and implementation. 
2.1.    Introduction
The robotic expect has 3 basic modes of the operation. First is the user manual mode, which is direct controlled of a user who uses a robot commander to transmit motion executives to the mobile robot. The second mode is the user assist mode, base on the user manual mode. the mobile robot can return data to the commander (To tell the user the distance of the mobile robot from the obstacle). It will improve the mobile robot motion and notify the user motion control set points. In addition, a "factory mode" should be included so that a group member can use it for testing and calibration. The user interface, or when starting the program, the user is able to set the maximum speed of the motor, and the user can switch the robot operation mode at anytime. 
2.1.1    Hardware components introduction:
There are 10 hardware components, the power board, Pololu 707 Dual motor driver board, Xbee, battery, sharp infrared sensor, LCD display, joystick, button, PIC18F4520 minimal board and dual PWM motors. The power board provides a connection point for the mobile robot battery and carry the Pololu motor driver board. The pololu motor driver board is a PWM motor controller. Xbee is use for sending data and executives from the commander to the mobile robot, and feedback signal/data can send back from the mobile robot to the commander via Xbee as well. Infrared sensors are using for measuring the distance of the mobile robot from the obstacles, and they are the tools for adjusting the motion when the robot is in automatic mode. LCD display is the user interface. It will display the welcome message and current status / mode of the robot, and feedback data from robot will be displayed on the LCD. User control the robot by using joystick. The joystick has 2 control channel, x axis and y axis motion control, hence it has 2 output and both output are analog. PIC18F4520 connect with the Xbee and motor driver board. 
PWM motors provide the motion of the robot, its speed is base on different duty cycle.
  
2.1.2.    Software components:
Software contain X parts. ADC, LCD display function, timer system, Xbee serial transmission interrupt, IR sensor module and PWM motor algorism. ADC will convert the analog signal from the joystick to digital signal to PIC18F board. LCD display indicates the status of the robot, and provide user input, for setting the maximum speed and yaw rate of the mobile robot, as well as the operation mode switching. Xbee serial transmission interrupt is a software component that transmit the commander executive to the robot, such as current speed input, joystick value (convert to digital value vla ADC module already). Feedback signal, such as the IR sensor reading will be transmitted from robot to commander via Xbee. IR sensor module will read the analog voltage from the IR sensor, then convert it to digital value. In user assist mode, the value will be sent to the commander LCD to assist the user. In full auto mode, the motion of the robot will depends on the reading of the IR sensors.
2.2.    Operational Scenarios

The mobile robot should have all motions, including forward, backward and turning.  In manual mode, the user can control the motions of the robot at anytime. 
The Robotic System shall be capable of carrying a Knight seated on a Saddle, and of accurately and rapidly manoeuvring when carrying the Knight such that the Knight is able to contest a jousting match of several passes against similar Robotic Systems. 
In auto mode, the mobile robot should move around the Tilt2 without hitting it. The Tilt2 will be 4.0 metres long and 100 mm high.

2.3.    System Requirements
The operational scenarios considered place certain requirements on the whole robot jousting system, including both commander and the mobile robot system, and on the modules that comprise it.
