#This folder holds all documentation

The documentation will be done alongside working on the code and design. We should not only save our final report here,
but the user manual and technical manual too. In addition, any design notes we create, such as meeting notes, presentation notes,
new designs that we are considering, new software structures to be implemented and any visual media to help us understand each other should be stored here.

ABOUT TECHNICAL MANUAL
- Please copy your section and the file MTX3700report.tex to your own area to work on it. You only open your .tex file and build it in Latex and view just your 		section. Do not build MTRX3700report.tex as it will not work.
- Look at MTRX3700report.pdf if you want to have a look at the big picture.
- ONLY SAVE YOUR SECTION TO GITHUB. Do not save MTRX3700report.tex
