#This folder holds all documentation

The documentation will be done alongside working on the code and design. We should not only save our final report here,
but the user manual and technical manual too. In addition, any design notes we create, such as meeting notes, presentation notes,
new designs that we are considering, new software structures to be implemented and any visual media to help us understand each other should be stored here.
